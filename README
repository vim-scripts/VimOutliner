* What is VimOutliner?

VimOutliner is an outline processor with many of the same features as Grandview, More, Thinktank, Ecco, etc. Features include tree expand/collapse, tree promotion/demotion, level sensitive colors, interoutline linking, and body text.

What sets VimOutliner apart from the rest is that it&#039s been constructed from the ground up for fast and easy authoring.  Keystrokes are quick and easy, especially for someone knowing the Vim editor. The mouse is completely unnecessary (but is supported to the extent that Vim supports the mouse). Many of the VimOutliner commands start with a double comma because that&#039s very quick to type.

Many of the VimOutliner commands start with a double comma ",," because that's very quick to type. All VimOutliner files have the ".otl" extension. For an overview of the VimOutliner commands you can type ":h vo_cheatsheet" when you have opened an otl file. For help on VimOutliner type ":h vo"
